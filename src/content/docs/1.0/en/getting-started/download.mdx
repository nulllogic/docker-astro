## Package managers



### npm

Install Bootstrap in your Node.js powered apps with [the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap):

```sh
npm install bootstrap@{{< param "current_version" >}}
```

`const bootstrap = require('bootstrap')` or `import bootstrap from 'bootstrap'` will load all of Bootstrap's plugins onto a `bootstrap` object.
The `bootstrap` module itself exports all of our plugins. You can manually load Bootstrap's plugins individually by loading the `/js/dist/*.js` files under the package's top-level directory.

Bootstrap's `package.json` contains some additional metadata under the following keys:

- `sass` - path to Bootstrap's main [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) source file
- `style` - path to Bootstrap's non-minified CSS that's been compiled using the default settings (no customization)
