title: Tooltip
description: A tooltip is like a digital whisper, providing a brief message or hint when you hover over an element on a website. It's the digital equivalent of a helpful friend, quietly offering guidance or information without interrupting your browsing experience. With a tooltip, you can quickly get the information you need, without having to search for it or ask for help.
